# ThemeGen Issues & Feedback

As the user base for [ThemeGen](https://themegen.app) grows there needs to be a place to be able to raise issues and leave feedback about the project. This repository was created with that in mind.

If you've used the app and have any comments, feedback, or suggestions then please take a moment to leave a message by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/dgwyer/themegen-feedback/issues/new). At this stage motivation can be a problem so any words of encouragement goes a long way. :)

And of course, if you've found any issues then let me know and I'll take a look as soon as I can.

Hope you're all enjoying using the beta version of the app!
